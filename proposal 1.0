Proposal for projects to do at Data Incubator

Goal:

Use machine learning, based on twitter data, to predict a set of stocks prices, with an emphasis on reducing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Problem Statement:

Stock price is hard to predict. Among many creative approaches with very limited success, machine learning using online social media, e.g. Twitter, has attracted much attention. The first ground-braking work has shown that public sentiment analysis based on Twitter data has some predictive power on Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) [1]. Another more recent work [2], instead of analyzing tweets from everybody, focused only on tweets that are related to certain companies. It shows good correlation with these companies’ stock trading volume, however, weak correlation with their stock prices. 

The extreme difficulty of predicting stock prices using online social media results from two fundamental challenges:

1.	Ultra low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 
Due to the nature of online social media, most contents published have very little correlation with stock price movement. Even setting some filters when collecting Twitter data, like what [2] has done, is not going to reduce SNR to a degree that machine learning is able to work with good precision.  It is like to find a needle in a giant ocean to find real signal. 

2.	Volatility of signals. 
The correlation between many signals, if any, and stock price movement is volatile, due to the volatility of the market itself. It has been heard from The Street that the performance of their models halved every once a while if no effective updates are made. This leads to the question of how much and for how long can we trust a signal if we have found one.


Methodology

These two challenges seem hard to overcome, however, recently there is an interesting finding that there is strong correlation between the tweets from the CEO of Tesla, Elon Mask, and Tesla’s stock prices [3]. Although this work only involves with one particular person and stock, it indicates that it may be possible to tackle the above two challenges from a new perspective. The general methodology is designed as below:

1.	Reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
The first step toward SNR reduction is by selecting only those tweets that are stock related. This could be done by searching tweets containing certain keywords, e.g. $AAPL which refers to Apple’s stock price. 

Furthermore, most tweets, even selected in this way, do not provide any insight on how a stock’s price would change, however, some, though few, are. Since stock market is a zero-sum market, most individual investors in the stock market are losing money. However, there are still a number of individuals, let’s call them alpha investors to differentiate them from the ordinary ones, who have deep insight on a particular set of stocks, and can make profit consistently for a long term. What these alpha investors say on Twitter regarding these stocks is of great value, and can be used as the predictive signal. 

To reduce SNR on Twitter for a stock, we not only need to filter out tweets that are not relevant to that stock, but also need to filter out tweets from ‘ordinary’ individual stock investors. By analyzing tweets associated with that stock from each Twitter user, we can learn what he/she thinks about the stock price’s next movement. We can then compare it with the actual stock price movement, and calculate their correlation. Those whose tweets have strong correlation with that stock’s price are referred to as alpha users in this project

In this way, I would expect a considerable amount of SNR reduction by focusing on not only stock relevant tweets, but also relevant users.

2.	Consolidate signals
Since everyone makes mistakes, we should not rely on only one alpha user, but group them together and analyze their tweets as a whole.  Statistically, this would lead to a lower variance and improve the accuracy of the signal.



Proposed milestones: 

1.	Data collection: pre-selected stocks
a.	Many stocks have few discussions on Twitter. In order to gain enough data for analysis, only stocks with top tweets volume are selected. Tweets related to these stocks are searched and fetched through Twitter API. Since Twitter only opens its most recent one-week’s data to the public, a Python code runs on a weekly basis to continuously collect all tweets of interest for 6 months (2014-02 to 2014-08). The keywords used for search are listed here (https://github.com/bugatti1001/Project-for-Data-Incubator).
b.	The prices of the selected stocks are fetched through Yahoo Finance.

Note: This step has been accomplished through collaboration with my friends.

2.	Twitter user filtering: the key to reducing signal to noise ratio (SNR) 

For each stock, use machine learning to find out a set of Twitter users whose tweets have consistent and strong correlation with that stock’s price movement, e.g. Elon’s tweets on Tesla stocks. Different measures should be experimented to yield the lowest testing error in step 3. 

This is the most important part of this project. If succeeded, it would provide a group of Twitter users, or alpha users, whose tweets are mostly correlated with the stock price movements. 

3.	Stock price prediction

By aggregating all alpha users’ tweets, statistically it is expected that SNR will be further reduced. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms based on this finalized data set to make stock price prediction. Testing errors should be cross validated. 


Initial data exploration and findings
1.	Quality users are minority
Initial data exploration on one month’s Twitter data shows that only less than 3 % of tweets are from users with more than 50 followers, who are referred to as quality users in this project. The portion further decreases to 1.2 %, for tweets that have been liked more than five times.  This confirms the high SNR challenge mentioned in the “problem statement” section.

However, the good news is that although the portion of quality users is low, the total number of quality users is not small. There are over a thousand quality users in 2014-03 posted at least two tweets per day on our selected stocks. Although the ultimate alpha users are not the same as quality users, it is optimistic that the number of alpha users would be on the hundred level. 

Result is summarized in figure 1. 

2.	Weak signal is found with everyone included
Without knowing who are the alpha users yet, I did some data analysis based on 3 week’s selected Twitter data in a previous project, without filtering out anyone’s tweets. The prediction is based on a simple idea of ‘key words frequency analysis’. The details can be found here [4]. 

The key result is shown in figure 2.
