most tweets about a consumer product company, like Apple, is about its products. most is not about its stock price prediction. so maybe
these companies are not good examples. Regarding these companies, stocktwit's data would be much more valuable.

about 70% of all tweets data contains 'gold'.
remove tweets of the pattern "I've collected xxx gold coins..." ( ~ 50% in march!)
gold is still the largest tweet category. 
many tweets are not related to stock price predictions. however, if lucky, maybe I can still find some 'alpha' users by having a good set of 
key words for scoring tweets.

consider testing 3.5 + 3.5 for a week; the first 3.5 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, half Wednesday) as 1 data point, the latter 3.5 days as the other data point. this will increase the 
number of active users. this might amplify the signal. why 3.5d? weekends market is closed.

for AAPL in March, most tweets are non-stock price related, but news/facts related. However, there are still some people expressing their
strong opinions about stock price movement. For the initial findings, focus on these usesr. aggregate over longer time, and by 3.5 days. 
use "Wednesday open - Monday open" as the first point and "Friday close - Wednesday close" as the second, to minimize price noise and 
amplify signal from tweets.
